Kabuli Pulao – The Afghan National Dish
Main dishesRiceLamb
Kabuli Pulao is an incredibly delicious dish from Afghanistan, as the name suggests. This light and aromatic rice dish with lamb, other meat or poultry, that’s jeweled with carrots and raisins is the Afghan national dish. It is also popular in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Other forms of the spelling include Qabuli Pulao, Qabeli Palaw and Qabuli Palau. In Persian, we call it Qabeli Polo.

Qabuli, Qabeli, Kabuli, … whatever you may call it, it’s absolutely drool-worthy and I dare you to give it a try! The first time I had it in an Afghan restaurant a few years back and it became one of my favourite dishes. I’m sure you’ll love it too, so I just had to borrow this yummy dish from our neighbours and come up with a recipe for it.
